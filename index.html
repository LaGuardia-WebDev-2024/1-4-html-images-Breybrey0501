    <h1>The perfect trip</h1>

    <p>
      I would love to go somewhere that would culture shock me, for example
      Japan or Italy.<br />
      <li>
        I would want to travel to <em>Japan</em> when the Cherry blossom tress
        are.... blossoming.
      </li>

      <br />
      <li>
        <em>And I would want to</em> travel to Italy to learn about the history
        and visit historic places, that I can only see in the movies.
      </li>

    </p>

    <p>
      I would love to shop at both places and see how different they are from
      the stores and mall in USA.
    </p>

    <p>And the food would prob be more authentic perhapsüòç</p>
